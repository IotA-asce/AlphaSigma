# Prompt Guidelines

## Style Header

When generating a story plan or rendering a video, include the desired visual style as a `style` HTTP header. The planner forwards this header to the model so output reflects the chosen aesthetic.

## Telephoto and Anamorphic Constraints

Maintain a neutral, cinematic look by avoiding extreme telephoto compression or anamorphic distortion. Keep focal lengths in a standard range and do not request anamorphic lenses unless absolutely required.

## Dialogue Guidance

Write dialogue in concise, natural lines. Prefix each line with the speaker's name followed by a colon and limit individual quotes to one or two sentences to preserve pacing.
